/*
Race Track Simulation
Create a program that simulates a race between three runners. Each runner is represented by a separate 
thread. The race consists of 5 laps, and after each lap, the runner needs to take a short break. Use 
\the Thread.Sleep() method to simulate the time taken for each lap and break. At the end of the race, 
the main thread should wait for all runner threads to finish before announcing the results.
