/*
In many applications, there are certain values that donâ€™t change once they are assigned. 
Observe the equation below and decide which needs to be specified as a final and print 
the result as shown in sample test cases.

Equation: x*y + 45 + 3.14*z . Do not use 45 and 3.14 directly in order to calculate the 
result. Store them in a final variable.

Note : Take x,y from user which are integers and z as double
Sample test case:
Command line args 2 3 5.2
The result is 67.328
